# CompSciAR
 Mobile application to assist students learning computer science through the use of AR

This repository is the Unity project for a mobile application that is used to teach computing concepts through the use of augmented reality.

Currently, there is one topic implemented of classes and objects. 

You can learn about computer science concepts through AR, 3D models, and animations. The first example implemented uses car objects

More changes are soon to come with implementations of:<br>
    - Different class examples (Animal and Book)<br>
    - Voiceovers presenting prompts<br>
    - Sound effects for animations<br>
    - Code snippet feature to show example code<br>
